## Description
The script will batch decrypt multiple .wsdcf vr files inside a folder, and convert them to .mp4, you will need jav-it.exe, VR.mod file, this script, inside the same folder were the vr videos are stored, is also suggest to temporany unistall Steam VR, or it will pop up each video that the script will decrypt.

## Installation for the script
1. Install the latest python version from: https://www.python.org/downloads/ (tick add to PATH option)
2. Install the python depencies, by running this command on CMD: pip install tqdm
3. Open the script and replace the path dmmVideoPlayer with your path where DMMVRPlayer_Windows.exe is located, save the script.
4. Transfer jav-it.exe, VR.MOD, vrDecryptor.py, inside the same folder where all the .wsdcf encrypted files are located.
5. Unistall SteamVR untill the decryption is over.
6. Open 1 video manually and do the Log in, no VPN required.
7. Open CMD move to the script location and run the script using: python vrDecryptor.py
P.S. I suggest to decrypt max 200 files x run, too many will cause some issue.
